SUMMARY:The Silver Bullet Syndrome (Hadi Hariri)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity 
DESCRIPTION:#programmer's life #trends #making choices\n\nWe love our silver bullets don’t we? Constantly chasing the dream that the next big thing will solve all our past problems. It doesn’t matter if it’s a language\, framework\, platform or library\, we’re out there chasing it. Why? Well because it’s going to solve our needs\, it’s going to solve the business needs. Well supposedly it will. And how much is it going to cost? Not that much\, especially if we’re not the ones paying the bills. It’s about time we look at the hard facts and ask those difficult questions. Are we really looking for a silver bullet? Why are we constantly riding the technology bandwagon? Where is the churn going to take us? And at what cost?

SUMMARY:Effective Microservice Communication and Conversation Patterns (Jimmy Bogard)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 1)
DESCRIPTION:#architecture #microservices #protocols\n\nOrchestration or Choreography? Sagas or process manager? REST\, RPC or Events? Are we just making this all up as we go along? Once we move away from a single process to many services and processes\, we immediately hit the problem that our services need to communicate with each other. The architect mandated REST! But then nothing worked in production. Then came events! And nothing ever completed. In this talk we'll look at the problem from a holistic perspective - take the fundamental property of autonomy for any microservice-based architecture\, and design how services should communicate so that they can still achieve their purpose in the world. We'll cover basic communication patterns\, where we run into problems with them\, and how advanced conversational patterns can help. Finally\, we'll look at some real-world scenarios for designing complex coordination and where conversation patterns can retain our autonomy and loose coupling.

SUMMARY:Refactoring with Exuberance (Katrina Owen)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#coding #clean code #refactoring\n\nWhen is it okay to build an orbital laser to destroy an ant-hill? Many cry "overkill" when design principles are applied to trivial problems. And for good reason: in the context of work\, excessive embellishment gets us into trouble. Complexity costs us time and money. This talk explores how stepping outside of the realm of work and applying outrageous engineering practices to toy problems can deepen our understanding of the trade-offs that we make. Comically simple problems provide the perfect ground for developing actionable heuristics which can be applied to those monstrous complexities that we face in the real world.

SUMMARY:Things Every Developer Needs to Know About Database Indexing (Kai Sassnowski)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#databases #internals #deep-dive\n\nThis talk dives deep into a topic that I believe developers don't know enough about: database indexing. There are four sections to this talk: - What's an index? * How to create an index? * Understanding the execution plan * Common pitfalls What's an index In the first part we will learn what an index actually is. And we're talking data structures. How is an index actually represented internally and what are the implications of that. This is important because it makes certain characteristics of indexes much easier to understand.

SUMMARY:The World Needs Full-Stack Craftspeople (Anton Keks)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#professionalism #extreme programming #career\n\nDevelopers and IT people in general tend to specialize and become narrowly skilled. In the past there was always the conflict of DB developers vs application developers\, or DBA vs developers vs testers. Nowadays developers split even more into front-end/back-end/Android/iOS/whatever else. This leads to inflated teams\, inefficient communication\, lack of each developer's responsibility\, low team's truck factor\, and inability to solve production/design problems once and for all instead of applying patches here and there. The term "full-stack" is often applied to developers being responsible for all aspects of their work\, but XP/craftsmanship practices go further — we should also take our communication\, requirements\, operations\, testing\, etc. under control. True сraftsmen can be an order of magnitude more efficient than narrowly skilled developers. They not only write code\, but solve problems. Surely you want to be one. Let's break it down and see why it works.

SUMMARY:Prioritizing Technical Debt as if Time and Money Matters (Adam Tornhill)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#strategic refactoring #technical debt #code analysis\n\nMany codebases contain code that is overly complicated\, hard to understand\, and hence expensive to change and evolve. Prioritizing technical debt is a hard problem as modern systems might have millions of lines of code and multiple development teams -- no-one has a holistic overview. In addition\, there's always a trade-off between improving existing code versus adding new features so we need to use our time wisely. So what if we could mine the collective intelligence of all contributing programmers\, and start to make decisions based on information from how the organization actually works with the code? In this presentation you'll see how easily obtained version-control data let us uncover the behavior and patterns of the development organization. This language-neutral approach lets you prioritize the parts of your system that benefit the most from improvements\, so that you can balance short- and long-term goals guided by data. The specific examples are from real-world codebases like Android\, the Linux Kernel\, .Net Core Runtime\, and more. This new perspective on software development will change how you view code.

SUMMARY:The Soul of Erlang and Elixir (Saša Jurić)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#distributed systems #fault tolerance #live demo\n\nWhether you're developing a small web site or a large-scale distributed system\, Erlang and Elixir are great tools for building server-side systems. Both languages can help you start quickly and deal with highly complex problems at a large scale. This talk aims to explain what makes Erlang and Elixir suitable for such tasks. We'll look past the syntax and the ecosystem\, focusing instead on the concurrency model of these languages. Combining a bit of high-level theory and a couple of demos\, we'll examine some important properties of Erlang/Elixir concurrency\, with a special emphasis on why these properties are very relevant when building highly available systems. The talk targets experienced backend developers\, but no knowledge of Erlang or Elixir is required. You will walk away from the talk with a better understanding of what distinguishes Erlang and Elixir from the rest of the pack\, and why these languages are very compelling choices to power your next software system.

SUMMARY:The Effective Developer (Sven Peters)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#effectiveness #productivity #deep work\n\nWe’re agile\, we’re doing DevOps\, we work in cross-functional teams\, and we use the latest developer pipeline tooling. With all those methodologies and technologies we should be highly effective\, right? Probably not. Most of us still struggle with balancing coding speed and quality\, working on the stuff that really makes a difference\, and feeling constantly stressed by all the things we should learn. Effective developers don't just write clean\, simple\, and robust code. They also have a strong understanding of the entire development process and the problem that needs to be solved. They take time to learn\, practice\, and play. Learn how those developers build effective coding habits\, use automations whenever needed\, reserve time for deep work\, and much more. You’ll walk away from this talk with lots of ideas on how to work smarter\, not harder.

LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:\n\nDevOps - a simple term\, but tons of confusion. Some think\, it is about more collaboration between Dev and Ops. Others think\, it is just about tools and automation. But in its core\, DevOps is about accelerating the IT value chain. How long does it take to deliver a business idea to your customer using IT? How fast can you go - repeatedly and without compromising quality? But why should we speed up in the first place? Do we really need it? How fast is fast enough? How can we implement it? What else do we need to take into account? ... lots of questions if we follow this thought for a moment. In this session we will try to answer some of the questions. We will examine the drivers and goals behind DevOps and answer the question why we need to change. Then we will see how DevOps affects the way we think and act\, what else is needed to really "become DevOps" and how all these building blocks are connected to each other. Finally\, we will have a brief peek into the (likely) future of DevOps.

DESCRIPTION:\n\nA well-balanced programmer feels comfortable dealing with designing software\, managing projects\, and working with people. Companies seem to want to hire "the best"\, but well-balanced programmers relatively rare. Although many programmers feel confident arguing about algorithms\, modularity\, and scalability in design sessions\, they would stand out from their peers if they also had incredible habits for managing their work\, knew how to negotiate features with product owners\, had intelligent conversations with project managers about the risks in their project\, and understood what lies behind the irrationality of the people and systems around them. Sadly\, most programmers don't appreciate the value of these skills. Others don't know how to get started learning them. I started programming computers because people are messy! I'd like to share a curated collection of concepts for you explore that will help you become irresistibly valuable to your employer or clients. I plan to share the design principles and programming techniques that amplified my skills the most over the last 20 years. In addition\, I'll describe how I learned the key non-programming concepts\, techniques\, and approaches that have endeared me to fellow programmers\, managers\, and clients. I offer you a very practical approach to issues like influencing peers\, negotiating with stakeholders\, and adopting new ways of working safely. I'll help you start to build a personal work system that will free your mind to do your best work. I know how this might sound. I promise to share concrete techniques that you can begin applying right away. Of course\, these techniques aren't magic\, so you'll have to read some more and practise on your own\, but you will know how to get started right away on becoming the well-balanced programmer that every manager and co-worker will love to have on their team.

DESCRIPTION:\n\nUnit testing is fine\, but without proper integration testing\, especially if you work with external resources like databases and other services\, you might not know how your application will actually behave once it has been deployed to the real production environment. Testcontainers is a popular JVM testing library that provides lightweight\, throwaway instances of common databases\, Selenium web browsers\, or anything else that can run in a Docker container. In this talk\, we will briefly go throught the past\, present and the future of the library.

DESCRIPTION:\n\nAs information workers\, we are asked to absorb even more information than ever before. More blogs\, more documentation\, more patterns\, more layers of abstraction. Now Twitter and Facebook compete with Email and Texts for our attention\, keeping us up-to-date on our friends dietary details and movie attendance second-by-second. Does all this information take a toll on your psyche or sharpen the saw? Is it a matter of finding the right tools and filters to capture what you need\, or do you just need to unplug.

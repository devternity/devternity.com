SUMMARY:The Silver Bullet Syndrome (Hadi Hariri)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity 
DESCRIPTION:#technology #trends #keynote\n\nWe love our silver bullets don’t we? Constantly chasing the dream that the next big thing will solve all our past problems. It doesn’t matter if it’s a language\, framework\, platform or library\, we’re out there chasing it. Why? Well because it’s going to solve our needs\, it’s going to solve the business needs. Well supposedly it will. And how much is it going to cost? Not that much\, especially if we’re not the ones paying the bills. It’s about time we look at the hard facts and ask those difficult questions. Are we really looking for a silver bullet? Why are we constantly riding the technology bandwagon? Where is the churn going to take us? And at what cost?

SUMMARY:Elixir — Easy Fun for Busy Developers (David Schmitz)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#live coding #new language #distributed systems\n\nDid you ever want to create an application that is never down? Have you ever been jealous of those Erlang guys\, that produce applications that practically never fail? Have you tried Erlang and fled because of its baroque syntax and tooling? Enter Elixir! Elixir combines Ruby's love for programmers with the absolute power that is the Erlang platform. This talk will introduce programmers to Elixir and OTP. You will gain an understanding of what Elixir brings to the table and how to build highly scale-able systems with a toolset that is actually fun to use. Even if you will never use Elixir and OTP for you projects\, you will learn some of the concepts\, that make Erlang into such a powerful ecosystem.

SUMMARY:The Well-Balanced Programmer (J.B. Rainsberger)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#productivity #work habits #software design\n\nA well-balanced programmer feels comfortable dealing with designing software\, managing projects\, and working with people. Companies seem to want to hire "the best"\, but well-balanced programmers relatively rare. Although many programmers feel confident arguing about algorithms\, modularity\, and scalability in design sessions\, they would stand out from their peers if they also had incredible habits for managing their work\, knew how to negotiate features with product owners\, had intelligent conversations with project managers about the risks in their project\, and understood what lies behind the irrationality of the people and systems around them. Sadly\, most programmers don't appreciate the value of these skills. Others don't know how to get started learning them. I started programming computers because people are messy! I'd like to share a curated collection of concepts for you explore that will help you become irresistibly valuable to your employer or clients. I plan to share the design principles and programming techniques that amplified my skills the most over the last 20 years. In addition\, I'll describe how I learned the key non-programming concepts\, techniques\, and approaches that have endeared me to fellow programmers\, managers\, and clients. I offer you a very practical approach to issues like influencing peers\, negotiating with stakeholders\, and adopting new ways of working safely. I'll help you start to build a personal work system that will free your mind to do your best work. I know how this might sound. I promise to share concrete techniques that you can begin applying right away. Of course\, these techniques aren't magic\, so you'll have to read some more and practise on your own\, but you will know how to get started right away on becoming the well-balanced programmer that every manager and co-worker will love to have on their team.

SUMMARY:The Clean Architecture (Ian Cooper)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 2)
DESCRIPTION:#architecture #.net examples\n\nWhat is the clean architecture and how you would build one in .NET? Recently Bob Martin has categorized a set of architectures\, including hexagonal architecture\, onion architecture and screaming architecture as 'the clean architecture' - a layered architecture of concentric circles with a strong emphasis on separation of concerns. This architecture has become popular because of its amenability to modification as an evolutionary architecture and its support for practices such as TDD. In this presentation we will discuss the clean architecture and its benefits. More than that\, in the bulk of the presentation\, we will show you how to implement a clean architecture in .NET. From first steps to working code\, we will show you the moves required to embrace this approach\, and introduce you to some of the OSS libraries that can help you get there. All examples will be in .NET Core

SUMMARY:Programming Style & Your Brain (Douglas Crockford)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#coding #code readability #linting\n\nComputer programs are the most complicated things humans make. They must be perfect\, which is hard for us because we are not perfect. Programming is thought to be a "head" activity\, but there is a lot of "gut" involved. Indeed\, it may be the gut that gives us the insight necessary for solving hard problems. But gut messes us up when it come to matters of style.The systems in our brains that make us vulnerable to advertising and propaganda also influence our programming styles. This talk looks systematically at the development of a programming style that specifically improves the reliability of programs. The examples are given in JavaScript\, a language with an uncommonly large number of bad parts\, but the principles are applicable to all languages.

SUMMARY:Vertical Slice Architecture (Jimmy Bogard)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 1)
DESCRIPTION:#architecture #domain-driven design #.net examples\n\nMoving from a layered architecture to a vertical slice architecture can be a bit daunting. We remove abstractions\, complex structures\, and focus building on the axis of change\, then what's next? What new structures\, patterns\, and policies will need to be introduced in this style of architecture? How will we deal with common business functionality\, and where do concepts like CQRS and DDD fit in? In this session\, we'll introduce the idea of vertical slice architectures\, and dive into the patterns\, tools\, and techniques used with slices. We'll also cover how you can fit vertical slices into different kinds of systems\, from desktop\, SPA\, and normal MVC applications. Finally\, we'll look at some of the new challenges that come with slices and layers\, and how a different approach provides a much more maintainable end result.

SUMMARY:Event-Driven Architecture Traps (Jakub Pilimon)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity (Track 3)
DESCRIPTION:#cqrs #event sourcing #spring\n\nEvent-driven architectures (EDA) have become more popular by the day. Organizations see a great value in them\, and developers love how EDA help to grow\, scale\, and mirror what really happens in the business domain. However\, most developers are not familiar with this kind of architecture\, which can lead to common pitfalls that we’ll examine in this talk. We’ll also cover a broad set of concepts like: Spring Cloud Stream\, exactly-once delivery (is that event a thing?)\, GDPR\, CQRS\, and tackle the problem of how to version our events. There will be code and the presentation requires basic knowledge about distributed systems.

SUMMARY:Lean Code (Kevlin Henney)
SEQUENCE:0
LOCATION:DevTernity 
DESCRIPTION:#general programming #coding #best practices\n\nLean has been applied as a toolkit to fine-tune development processes and organisational workflow\, but what does it mean when we apply the practices to the detail of the code\, the practices used to develop it and the people who develop it? What does Lean Code and its creation look like? There is a need to move beyond often separated worlds of software craft and agile development\, to properly embrace code in its detail\, but to also connect it more completely to the flow of business and the intelligence of people around it. To move beyond simple exhortations of clean code to something more human. This talk offers a fresh look at Lean principles and practices from the perspective of the code and the coder\, rather than the usual scale of the organisation and the development process.
